Add the Zotero plugin, bundled with the CLI. It reads a local Zotero library and emits a `BookmarkAction` for each saved work, a `ViewAction` for each file's last open, and `QuoteAction`s and `AnnotateAction`s for highlights and notes. The vocabulary adds `Article`, the page and EPUB CFI selectors, and the properties they use, and moves `Message` and `SoftwareApplication` under `CreativeWork`.
