Record kinds can follow the source (`chronicle extract github stars gists`), and kinds read by separate extractors now run together instead of failing as ambiguous: newest first when each extractor implements the new `occurredAt(record)` hook, one after another otherwise. `-t all` reads every kind, `-t defaults` the plugin's defaults. A plugin that declares no default kinds gets a picker on a bare run (space selects, enter starts, `a` all, `d` defaults), and outside a terminal an error saying how to name kinds; GitHub declares none. A run of several kinds says which it reads, and which it leaves out. The run summary puts the outcome on one line and a line per kind under it.
