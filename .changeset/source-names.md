Arc Timeline runs as `chronicle extract arc-timeline` instead of `arc`; its records keep the `arc` namespace. The Call History plugin is now `@chronicle.app/apple-call-history`, run as `chronicle extract apple-call-history` instead of `apple-phone`, and its records (and Timing's relayed calls, which fold with them) use the `apple-call-history` namespace, named for Apple's CallHistory store (`com.apple.CallHistory`), which holds phone and FaceTime calls alike. The `sources` table names the plugin where it matters: the one to install when its name differs from the source's, which local plugin is running a source, and which package outside the catalog provides one.
