Read the Apple Account from the system Accounts database when MobileMeAccounts is empty, as it is on newer macOS, so the account owner is keyed by their DSID again. `buildICloudPersonSchema` now returns `null` when no account can be read, instead of a Person keyed only by `['@type', 'source']` that every account-less owner shared; Safari and iMessage leave the owner out in that case. iMessage's SMS owner with no identifier is left out the same way.
