# @chronicle.app/lastfm

## 0.4.0

### Patch Changes

- a7fb44c: A missing stored credential now points at `chronicle auth set <source>`, the command that stores static tokens, instead of `chronicle auth login`, which only OAuth sources support. Last.fm and Foursquare, which sign in with OAuth, still point at `auth login`.
- 59904c0: Name failures, and exit with codes a supervisor can act on. `@chronicle.app/etl` exports typed errors: `AuthRequired` (exit 3), `InputNotFound` and `PermissionDenied` (4), `RateLimited` with `retryAfter` (5), and `ExtractorError` with any `code`, each with a `hint` for the next step. `ApiAuthError` and `ApiRateLimitError` are now the typed ones. The runner reports an error that ends a run as an `error` event with its code, exit code, and hint; the CLI prints it once, the hint beneath, and exits with its code. A missing or unreadable input names the file and exits 4, and every SQLite source now explains a macOS Full Disk Access refusal instead of printing `unable to open database file`. Credentials problems point to `chronicle auth login <source>`. Plugins can add a next step to a successful run with `this.hint(message, { action })`, printed under the summary. `fileError` and `assertReadable` turn file-system failures into typed errors. Hints are marked `↳` and wrap without splitting a `code span`. Things reports a blocked or missing library folder the same way, instead of a raw `EPERM: scandir`, and a typed error thrown while a run is being built is reported like one from the run.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 4bf4f8c: Add the Last.fm plugin, bundled with the CLI. It reads listens, loved tracks, and friends from the Last.fm API and emits `ListenAction`, `LikeAction`, `FollowAction`, and `CreateAction` records, and registers a `lastfm` provider for `chronicle auth login`.

### Patch Changes

- f400092: `chronicle sources` lists one row per source from a plugin catalog that ships with the CLI, with whether each source is installed or can run on this machine. Legacy sources for services that no longer exist (Google Reader, Moves, Marvin) are hidden unless you pass `--all`; the table says how many it left out, and marks them legacy when shown. `sources` and `sources info` read each plugin's `chronicle` manifest in its package.json instead of importing the plugin, and `sources info` shows the platforms and permissions a source needs. `--format json` now has one object per source, with its strategies nested under `strategies`. The table's Via column is now Strategy, `extract` takes `--strategy` (`--via` is gone), and help and messages say "strategies" instead of "ways in".
- f400092: The CLI bundles only shell, imessage, safari, things-todo, and claude-code. Install any other source with `chronicle plugins install <name>`, using its short name from `chronicle sources`, or run `chronicle extract <source>` on a terminal and accept the offer to install it. `plugins install` also takes a package name or a local path, and installs into the Chronicle data directory with your own npm; `chronicle plugins` lists installed plugins and `plugins uninstall` removes one. Plugins installed beside the CLI with `npm install -g` are now found, and plugins in the current directory's `node_modules` no longer are. Installed plugins share the CLI's `@chronicle.app/etl`, `schema`, and `auth`, so their OAuth providers appear in `chronicle auth`. The CLI no longer depends on `@oclif/plugin-plugins`, and plugins drop their empty `oclif` field.
