### Minor Changes

- d69e45f: An ID names one thing. An action that a source gives no ID of its own no longer takes the ID of what it acted on or made as its `sourceId`, which gave two nodes one ID. It is keyed through that node instead, by `object.sourceId` or `result.sourceId`, and also by its time where it can happen more than once.

  An action is keyed by what it acted on: a Things action by its task, a Google Calendar plan by its event, an opened GitHub issue by the issue, a Google Reader read, share, or star by the item and you, a Twitter like by the tweet, a Last.fm or YouTube follow by the account it follows, a Zotero save by the item, and a Zotero view by the item and when.

  An action that makes something has it as its `result` and is keyed by it. Every `MessageAction` has its `Message` as its `result`, as iMessage's does: in Claude Code, Email, Gmail, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Slack, Twitter, and WhatsApp too. A `PublishAction` has the work it published as its `result`: a Bluesky post, an Instagram post, a tweet, a YouTube video, a GitHub pull request or gist, and a Hacker News submission. A call is keyed by its session, a voice memo by its recording, an Arc trip by its journey, and a Timing block or entry by its session. Highlighting is keyed by the quotation it made, in Marvin and Zotero, and commenting by the note or comment it made, in Marvin, Zotero, YouTube, Hacker News, and GitHub. Creating a GitHub repository and committing are keyed by the repository and the commit, creating an Are.na channel, block, or comment by what it made, rather than by IDs made up as `channel-11`, and registering a Last.fm account by the account.

  Nodes that shared an ID are keyed apart. An Instagram post, which the export gives no ID of its own, is keyed by the files it contains rather than by its first file's ID. A FoodNoms entry's ID is its action's, still without `@type`, so the eat-or-drink guess can change, and its `Meal` is keyed by the action it was eaten in. A comment on a Marvin or Zotero highlight, which shares the highlight's ID, is keyed by the quotation it is about. A WhatsApp attachment is keyed by its message. A Google Calendar event that names no one, such as a holiday or a subscribed feed's, has no agent, rather than its calendar standing in as an `Agent` with the calendar's ID.

  Google Reader's Share is a `ShareAction` of the item rather than a `PublishAction`, since it passed along an article someone else wrote. The vocabulary's `PublishAction` says its `result` is the work, and its examples show these keys. The schema site's keys guide and the plugin scaffold say how to key an action without an ID of its own.

  Records these plugins extracted before this release were keyed differently, so extracting them again adds new nodes beside the old ones, and the old messages and publications stay as their actions' `object`. Drop these plugins' records and extract them again.

- 266f585: `chronicle survey` counts what each source on this computer holds, and over which years, without extracting it. It surveys every source `chronicle scan` finds ready, all at once, and fills in a table as each answers, with where each count comes from. A source that isn't ready is listed with what's in its way, and what to do about it. One read online is listed as not surveyable, with the command that extracts it, and so, in a survey of a folder, a zip, or one source, is one that can't say how much it holds. `chronicle survey <source>` shows one source's records by year, and takes the options `extract` does, so `chronicle survey moves-app --input ~/moves_export` counts an export before you extract it. `--type`, `--since`, and `--until` count what a run with them would extract, and `--format json` or `csv` gives the counts as data.

  An extractor says how much a run would read with `survey()`. For each record type it gives a count, the first and last times, totals worth showing beside the count, like Chrome's pages or iMessage's conversations and attachment bytes, and, when asked, the records in each month. It's measured as cheaply as the source allows, with aggregate queries or file dates, and only a source with no other way to count reads every record. `@chronicle.app/etl-sqlite` adds `monthSql` and `countsByMonth` to count records by month in a query. Apple Call History, Apple Notes, Apple Podcasts, Voice Memos, Apple Wallet, Arc Timeline, Chrome, Claude Code, FoodNoms, iMessage, Moves, Obsidian, Safari, Shazam, the shell history, Things, Timing, WhatsApp, and Zotero each survey what they hold.

### Patch Changes

- 67d3035: `chronicle scan` finds the sources on this computer and says whether each is ready to extract, with the command that extracts it. `chronicle scan chrome` looks for one source, and `--format json` or `csv` lists every row with its command. It opens what it finds to check it can be read, reads none of it, and stays off the network. A row macOS blocks says it needs Full Disk Access, and a source whose plugin isn't installed says which plugin to install.

  A plugin's manifest says where each strategy's files are, as `locations` under the strategy: a path in the home folder, with `*` for any name within one folder and `{option}` for a name that is also the run's option, like Chrome's `{profile}`. A plugin can export a `Locator` from `@chronicle.app/etl` to name what a location matched, or to find what no path can. Chrome names each profile as its profile menu does, with the account it's signed in to. Obsidian lists each vault it has opened, and GitHub finds the credential a run would use without asking GitHub whether it still works.

- d34bb56: Zotero reads its library from the data folder Zotero's preferences name, when it was moved from `~/Zotero`, and a scan finds the library there too.

## 0.4.0

### Patch Changes

- 3b0a929: The Zotero and Obsidian plugins declare `chronicle.deepLinks` in their package.json again, so hosts that serve stored records can link them into the app.
- 59904c0: Name failures, and exit with codes a supervisor can act on. `@chronicle.app/etl` exports typed errors: `AuthRequired` (exit 3), `InputNotFound` and `PermissionDenied` (4), `RateLimited` with `retryAfter` (5), and `ExtractorError` with any `code`, each with a `hint` for the next step. `ApiAuthError` and `ApiRateLimitError` are now the typed ones. The runner reports an error that ends a run as an `error` event with its code, exit code, and hint; the CLI prints it once, the hint beneath, and exits with its code. A missing or unreadable input names the file and exits 4, and every SQLite source now explains a macOS Full Disk Access refusal instead of printing `unable to open database file`. Credentials problems point to `chronicle auth login <source>`. Plugins can add a next step to a successful run with `this.hint(message, { action })`, printed under the summary. `fileError` and `assertReadable` turn file-system failures into typed errors. Hints are marked `↳` and wrap without splitting a `code span`. Things reports a blocked or missing library folder the same way, instead of a raw `EPERM: scandir`, and a typed error thrown while a run is being built is reported like one from the run.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- b9ee0b1: Add the Zotero plugin, bundled with the CLI. It reads a local Zotero library and emits a `BookmarkAction` for each saved work, a `ViewAction` for each file's last open, and `QuoteAction`s and `AnnotateAction`s for highlights and notes. The vocabulary adds `Article`, the page and EPUB CFI selectors, and the properties they use, and moves `Message` and `SoftwareApplication` under `CreativeWork`.

### Patch Changes

- f400092: `chronicle sources` lists one row per source from a plugin catalog that ships with the CLI, with whether each source is installed or can run on this machine. Legacy sources for services that no longer exist (Google Reader, Moves, Marvin) are hidden unless you pass `--all`; the table says how many it left out, and marks them legacy when shown. `sources` and `sources info` read each plugin's `chronicle` manifest in its package.json instead of importing the plugin, and `sources info` shows the platforms and permissions a source needs. `--format json` now has one object per source, with its strategies nested under `strategies`. The table's Via column is now Strategy, `extract` takes `--strategy` (`--via` is gone), and help and messages say "strategies" instead of "ways in".
- f400092: The CLI bundles only shell, imessage, safari, things-todo, and claude-code. Install any other source with `chronicle plugins install <name>`, using its short name from `chronicle sources`, or run `chronicle extract <source>` on a terminal and accept the offer to install it. `plugins install` also takes a package name or a local path, and installs into the Chronicle data directory with your own npm; `chronicle plugins` lists installed plugins and `plugins uninstall` removes one. Plugins installed beside the CLI with `npm install -g` are now found, and plugins in the current directory's `node_modules` no longer are. Installed plugins share the CLI's `@chronicle.app/etl`, `schema`, and `auth`, so their OAuth providers appear in `chronicle auth`. The CLI no longer depends on `@oclif/plugin-plugins`, and plugins drop their empty `oclif` field.
- 651d031: Fix extractions that could fail partway with "statement has been finalized" on Node 22.13. `iterateRows` now keeps its statement referenced until iteration ends, and every extractor that iterated an inline `db.prepare(sql).iterate()` uses it.
