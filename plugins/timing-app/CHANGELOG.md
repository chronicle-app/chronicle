# @chronicle.app/timing-app

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 92674c9: Add the Timing plugin, bundled with the CLI. It reads app usage, logged time entries, and relayed phone calls from Timing's local database and emits `ExecuteAction`, `ExperienceAction`, and `CallAction` records. The vocabulary adds `DeviceSession`, `PhysicalObject`, `Device`, `Directory`, `workingDirectory`, `subject`, and `model`.

### Patch Changes

- f400092: `chronicle sources` lists one row per source from a plugin catalog that ships with the CLI, with whether each source is installed or can run on this machine. Legacy sources for services that no longer exist (Google Reader, Moves, Marvin) are hidden unless you pass `--all`; the table says how many it left out, and marks them legacy when shown. `sources` and `sources info` read each plugin's `chronicle` manifest in its package.json instead of importing the plugin, and `sources info` shows the platforms and permissions a source needs. `--format json` now has one object per source, with its strategies nested under `strategies`. The table's Via column is now Strategy, `extract` takes `--strategy` (`--via` is gone), and help and messages say "strategies" instead of "ways in".
- f400092: The CLI bundles only shell, imessage, safari, things-todo, and claude-code. Install any other source with `chronicle plugins install <name>`, using its short name from `chronicle sources`, or run `chronicle extract <source>` on a terminal and accept the offer to install it. `plugins install` also takes a package name or a local path, and installs into the Chronicle data directory with your own npm; `chronicle plugins` lists installed plugins and `plugins uninstall` removes one. Plugins installed beside the CLI with `npm install -g` are now found, and plugins in the current directory's `node_modules` no longer are. Installed plugins share the CLI's `@chronicle.app/etl`, `schema`, and `auth`, so their OAuth providers appear in `chronicle auth`. The CLI no longer depends on `@oclif/plugin-plugins`, and plugins drop their empty `oclif` field.
- 651d031: Fix extractions that could fail partway with "statement has been finalized" on Node 22.13. `iterateRows` now keeps its statement referenced until iteration ends, and every extractor that iterated an inline `db.prepare(sql).iterate()` uses it.
