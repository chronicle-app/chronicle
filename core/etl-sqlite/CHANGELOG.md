# @chronicle.app/etl-sqlite

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 266f585: `chronicle survey` counts what each source on this computer holds, and over which years, without extracting it. It surveys every source `chronicle scan` finds ready, all at once, and fills in a table as each answers, with where each count comes from. A source that isn't ready is listed with what's in its way, and what to do about it. One read online is listed as not surveyable, with the command that extracts it, and so, in a survey of a folder, a zip, or one source, is one that can't say how much it holds. `chronicle survey <source>` shows one source's records by year, and takes the options `extract` does, so `chronicle survey moves-app --input ~/moves_export` counts an export before you extract it. `--type`, `--since`, and `--until` count what a run with them would extract, and `--format json` or `csv` gives the counts as data.

  An extractor says how much a run would read with `survey()`. For each record type it gives a count, the first and last times, totals worth showing beside the count, like Chrome's pages or iMessage's conversations and attachment bytes, and, when asked, the records in each month. It's measured as cheaply as the source allows, with aggregate queries or file dates, and only a source with no other way to count reads every record. `@chronicle.app/etl-sqlite` adds `monthSql` and `countsByMonth` to count records by month in a query. Apple Call History, Apple Notes, Apple Podcasts, Voice Memos, Apple Wallet, Arc Timeline, Chrome, Claude Code, FoodNoms, iMessage, Moves, Obsidian, Safari, Shazam, the shell history, Things, Timing, WhatsApp, and Zotero each survey what they hold.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- b0982a5: Add the Chrome plugin. It reads browsing history from a Chrome profile's `History` database, including visits synced from other devices, and emits a `ViewAction` for each page visit. The agent is the profile's Google account, by its email address, as Gmail and Google Calendar know you. A visit reached by following a link or submitting a form also becomes a `NavigateAction` from the page it came from to the page it landed on, and that page `references` the link followed. The vocabulary adds `MoveAction` and `NavigateAction`. `@chronicle.app/etl-sqlite` adds `chromeToUnixMsSql` and `unixMsToChromeTimestamp` for Chromium's microseconds since 1601. `renderShapes` shows each further action a record becomes as its own node.

### Patch Changes

- 59904c0: Name failures, and exit with codes a supervisor can act on. `@chronicle.app/etl` exports typed errors: `AuthRequired` (exit 3), `InputNotFound` and `PermissionDenied` (4), `RateLimited` with `retryAfter` (5), and `ExtractorError` with any `code`, each with a `hint` for the next step. `ApiAuthError` and `ApiRateLimitError` are now the typed ones. The runner reports an error that ends a run as an `error` event with its code, exit code, and hint; the CLI prints it once, the hint beneath, and exits with its code. A missing or unreadable input names the file and exits 4, and every SQLite source now explains a macOS Full Disk Access refusal instead of printing `unable to open database file`. Credentials problems point to `chronicle auth login <source>`. Plugins can add a next step to a successful run with `this.hint(message, { action })`, printed under the summary. `fileError` and `assertReadable` turn file-system failures into typed errors. Hints are marked `↳` and wrap without splitting a `code span`. Things reports a blocked or missing library folder the same way, instead of a raw `EPERM: scandir`, and a typed error thrown while a run is being built is reported like one from the run.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- ea24fda: Add a protected `openDatabase(path)` to `SqliteExtractor` so subclasses can read a copy of a locked database or a database from a backup, `isSqliteBusy(err)` to recognize SQLITE_BUSY errors, and typed `allRows`, `getRow` and `iterateRows` statement helpers. The README now lists the `node:sqlite` differences that break code ported from better-sqlite3.

### Patch Changes

- 651d031: Fix extractions that could fail partway with "statement has been finalized" on Node 22.13. `iterateRows` now keeps its statement referenced until iteration ends, and every extractor that iterated an inline `db.prepare(sql).iterate()` uses it.

## 0.2.0

### Patch Changes

- c097762: Declare `@chronicle.app/etl` and `@chronicle.app/schema` as peer dependencies (`>=0.1.0 <1.0.0`) instead of exact dependencies, so plugins and the packages they build on share the host's copy instead of installing their own.
